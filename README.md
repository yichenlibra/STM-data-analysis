# Python Data Analysis of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) data
## Introduction
[Nanonispy](https://github.com/underchemist/nanonispy) was made in needing to do a lot of analysis for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data. I developed Python codes based on Nanonispy and traditional Python packages (such as Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly) for processing my self-collected STM data.

## Input and output of files
There are 4 Python codes used to analyze STM data. They all load dIdV map generated by STM. However, the output of each file is different from others. Their output details are as follow:
* "**dIdV map Analysis(Average, linecut, Variance).ipynb**": topography, zero bias conductance (ZBC), (partial) average spectra, linecuts from dIdV maps, histogram of ZBC and coherence peak conductance, background-subtracted spectra.
* "**dIdV map analysis_2.ipynb**": further analysis of histogram of ZBC, anomaly detection.
* "**Maps with vortices.ipynb**": interactive visualization of ZBC, linecut through and away from vortex with offset, linecut through and away from vortex overlapped, average spectra inside and outside vortex
* "**STM Data analysis.ipynb**": zero bias conductance (ZBC), (partial) average spectra, linecuts from dIdV maps.
